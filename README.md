With a focus on efficiency and user-friendly design, this TodoList app offers an intuitive interface that allows users to effortlessly manage their tasks and stay organized. Leveraging the power of MongoDB, a robust NoSQL database, I implemented seamless data storage and retrieval capabilities. Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool, enabled me to create clear and structured data schemas, ensuring data integrity throughout the application.

To enhance the functionality and user experience, I utilized Body-parser, a middleware that simplifies handling HTTP requests, allowing users to add, update, and delete tasks effortlessly. Additionally, I employed Lodash, a powerful utility library, to streamline data manipulation and optimize performance.

By harnessing the capabilities of Express, a fast and flexible Node.js web application framework, I built a solid foundation for the app, providing a seamless experience across various devices and platforms.

Through this project, I have not only demonstrated my proficiency in backend technologies like MongoDB and Express but also showcased my ability to integrate different libraries to create a cohesive and efficient application. I am proud of the results achieved, and I am excited to share this project as a testament to my passion for creating practical and user-centric solutions."
